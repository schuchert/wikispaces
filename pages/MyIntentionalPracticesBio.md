## Intentional Body Work Bio

Brett Schuchert is a professional software developer who applies agile and lean thinking to intentional body work.
He also applies intentional body work to software development.

He started teaching computer literacy courses in 1985, which required studying adult education theory. He also
studied the work of Virginia Satir, a person who created conjoint family theory, both under Jerry Weinberg and
with the Satir Institute of the SE.

He started practicing Taekwondo in college in 1989. He accidentally discovered what most people do
with any kind of intentional practice; fixing your body can fix your mind, fixing your mind, can fix your body.
This coupled with the model of Virginia Satir is a foundation for most of how he approaches work and life.

At the turn of the century, he started practicing hot, dynamic yoga. Early on, he experienced so-called "issues in his 
tissues" for the first time. This cemented his personal belief that mind/body separation is a false dichotomy.
He studied with Valerie Love in Oklahoma City, both with Yoga Certification, and several years of yoga practice.
Yoga is an integrated part of what he does, often practicing while walking the dog, but also at home.

Around 2014 he started studying Tai Chi, Liehubafa, and Bagua, along with general Qigong with 
[Rick Krause](https://taichiokc.com/), which he continues to this day. At the start of his practice with Rick,
he understood the value of intentional body work, but as with all of his previous work, he mainly focused on 
the physical body, as opposed to the energy body.

During this time, several things happened to further reinforce him of the importance of diet, sleep, and exercise. 
He takes a structural approach to health. For example, his computer is at a desk with a recumbent bike. It is 
easier to sit at the bike to use the computer. This ties back to the work of Jerry Weinberg and Virginia Satir.

Through the practice of several internal martial arts, and under the guidance of Rick, he started to fix old body 
issues related to a car accident in the late 80s.

He read the book "How To Change Your Mind," by Michale Pollan, which lead him to sitting meditation. Two weeks
of daily practice, he broke through on learning Liehubafa. Having been stuck for several months around 70% of
the way through the form, in a few hours on a plane flight, he managed to memorize the basic movements of the final
30% of the form, and then managed to practice the form end-to-end.

At the beginning of 2022, he started practicing [Science of Stretching](https://www.yogabody.com/stretching/). This 
is something that finally connected all of these practices together by unlocking stuck parts of his body. Through 
daily deep flexibility training, he has started to have a far better sense of the internal movement of muscles, 
and even energy.

He signed up for Flexibility Coach training in December 2023, and in going through the previous class, found 
adjustments to poses that unlocked his back, related to falling off a train bridge in 1980. He'll be teaching 
Science of Stretching based classes starting in April 2024, upon completion of the certification.

Now he thinks of all of these intentional practices, along with sitting meditation, as part of a web of options to 
improve your daily lived experience.

One final piece that is crucial to his success is his definition of "intentional practice." For him, anything
you choose to do, no matter how long, is intentional. The intention that is important, not the particular practice, 
or the duration. You are always practicing something. If you practice watching TV and eating potato chips, your
attention becomes your intention. If a practice is improving your lived experience. But the more you do without
intention, the more that becomes your attention. Shift your attention, to set your intention,.
