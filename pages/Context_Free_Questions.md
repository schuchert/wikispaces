## Context Free Questions
These come from [Exploring Requirements: Quality Before Design](http://www.geraldmweinberg.com/books.html) by Gause & Weinberg.

### Process

* Who is the client for X?
* What is a highly successful solution really worth to the client?
* (Ask this if the answer to the previous context-free question does not seem to justify the effort involved.)What is the real reason for wanting to solve this problem?
* Should we use a single design team, or more than one? 
* Who should be on the team(s)?
* How much time do we have for this project?
* What is the trade-off between time and value?
* Where else can the solution to this design problem be obtained?
* Can we copy something that already exists?

### Product

* What problem does this system solve?
* What problems could this system create?
* What environment is this system likely to encounter?
* What kind of precision is required or desired in the product?
* Will it affect staffing?
* How will you know if the product is a success?

### Metaquestions

* Am I asking you too many questions?
* Do my questions seem relevant?
* Are you the right person to answer these questions?
* Are your answers official?
* In order to be sure that we understand each other, I've found that it helps me to have things in writing so I can study them at my leisure. May I write down your answers and give you a written copy to study and approve?
* (Use this if your communication has been only in writing so far.) The written material has been helpful, but I find that I understand some things better if I can discuss them face to face. Can we get together at some point, so we can know each other better and can clarify some of these points?
* Is there anyone else who can give me useful answers?
* Is there someplace I can go to see the environment in which this product will be used?

### Meta-questions at the end of every conversation

* Is there anything else I should be asking you?
* Is there anything you would like to ask me?
* May I return or call you with more questions later, in case I don't cover everything this time?
