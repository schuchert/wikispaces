## Curriculum Vitae for Brett L. Schuchert

### Skill Summary
Brett has over 35 years of teaching experience and over 30 years of consulting and coaching experience. Early
in his career, Brett was introduced to Object-Oriented Programming and Constraint Theory, and later agile
software development, then in the past decade, lean thinking. 

While he maintains a number of hobbies such as photography, and gardening, he practices and teaches
internal martial arts, e.g., Tai Chi, and Qigong. In April 2024, he is expecting to certify as a Flexibility
Coach, which he will additionally teach.

Brett is a lateral thinker and mixes and mingles across domains. For example, he applies lean thinking to 
learning and teaching new ideas in both a technical realm, and internal martial arts training. The notion
of practice/katas he does in both software development, and body awareness. Meditation and paying attention to the 
moment are a cornerstone of Code Whispering, or listening to the code, versus projecting design on to it.

### Industrial Logic
August 2015 - Present

#### Senior Software Developer

#### Internal Product Development
Building, supporting, and updating a collection of educational games used to teach lean principles related to 
Batch Size, Work in Progress, and Queues / Handoff. The application is a mix of technologies, including:
* [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)
* [AWS Lambdas](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) via The [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) Framework
* [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/)
* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
* The use of which includes the following AWS Services
  * Cognito, IAM, S3, CloudWatch, API Gateway, DynamoDB, AWS Amplify, Cloud Formation, Textract

---- 

#### Customer Product Development
Building a ReactNative replacement for an existing Point of Sale Terminal in thousands of restaurants. The product was 
delivered into production on time, supporting backwards-compatibility with the original system, which eased
migration for existing customers. It also supported Android, iOS, both phones and tablets.

The customer was losing clients to competitors. Updating their 10-year-old system became untenable. 

During the development, we targeted several mobile devices, some with multiple displays. Supported different UX
experiences with those different formats, integrating with existing credit card terminals, and supporting different
payment flows. 

There was a mix of technologies and practices:
* [Ensemble Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_coding)
* Test Driven Development
* Trunk Based Development
* Continuous Deployment to test devices and one-click deployment (customer choice) into production
* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [Code Push](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* Native coding to support multiple screens in React Native

----

#### Instructor
* Taught our Testing and Refactoring Workshop both in person and guided.
* Taught our Continuous Deployment workshop
* Developed and taught a 1-day extension to our Continuous Development workshop called "0 to CD" where attendees create a build pipeline from scratch.

#### Lean Coach, Major Auto Manufacturer

##### First engagement, Software Development Coach
Embedded with a team and generally introducing XP practices, lean software development principles, improved automated 
testing practices, and changed overall project structure and build structure to make it far easier to work with the 
project for existing and new developers.  


##### Second Engagement, Software Development Coach
Embedded with 4 different teams, rotating between then. As with the first engagement, introduced XP practices, lean software
development principles, improved testing, and generally applying DevOps principles to overall development approach.  


##### Third Engagement, Software Development Coach
Embedded with a team and assisted in an internal transformation. As before, XP practices, lean principles. Starting
with this engagement, we introduced [DORA](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance)
metrics to track how process changes impact our delivery.   


##### Fourth Engagement, Software Development Coach
Embedded with a team and continued where the third engagement left off in terms of transformation. Over a 1-year period, 
the team reduced their cycle-time from around 8.5 days per story to around 2.5 days. The team had inherited a number
of existing code bases, so we also upgraded major software versions of Spring Boot, greatly improved delivery safety
through more and better automated tests, improved on acceptance testing, experimented with continuous deployment into
production (though most of our projects were CD into lower environments and 1-click run of push to production).  

During this engagement I also worked with two coach candidates, both who moved into coaching roles as employees.

---- 

#### Agile Coach, National Food Chain

Helped stand up a cross-functional team. The first team accomplishment increased 
the delivery success rate of marketing material to Point of Sale Terminals. Originally,
marketing material delivery was around 54% successful, meaning about 46% of roughly 80,000 
terminals successfully updated. We analyzed the failures, developed a tool to review
the distribution package, and in doing do increased the success rate to 96%. While the problem was years old,
our solution took 6 weeks, including training people in both practices such as TDD, as well as
conception, development, delivery and updating business processes to make this make the
change stick, and ultimately helped root out the source of many of the deployment failures in the
underlying CRM technology,  as well as the satellite network used for delivery of those materials.


#### Lean Coach, Middle-East Telecommunications Company
Working as part of a team of coaches, we helped a large Telecom on its delivery focus. At the beginning
of the engagement, average lead time was 26 weeks. After 2 months, the average dropped to 4 weeks.

----

### Independent Contractor
May 2015 - August 2015

Assisted a team in moving towards pull-based software development. Team originally had high work
in progress, frequent interruptions, and felt like development had nearly stopped moving. After 
a few months, most work was organized into approximately 1 day buckets, developers were no longer 
swapping between tasks throughout the day, and both the flow of delivery and the feel of working
on the team improved.

Title: Principal Consultant

#### Technical Lead, Client-Facing Responsive Web Presence

Worked as a technical lead for a customer-facing application developed to test out modes of client interaction. The
technical stack initially included Angular on the front end, Node in the mid-tier and a back end aggregation layer.
After a pivot based on customer research, the front-end solution simplified to simply JavaScript and JQuery, maintaining
the Node back end. Also assisted in solving inconsistent automated test execution based on changes to the technology
stack after the pivot.

#### Platform Architect, Clothing Retailer

Working as both a technical BA as well as an evangelist for the introduction and use of a corporation-wide
service-enabling software harness. Embedded with four teams transforming their in-store sales experience, mentoring team

tracking crew flight time. This is a required to fly system with a hard deadline of January 4, 2014 for complete
implementation and data deadline starting 28 days earlier. Developed functionality and coached other developers in both
coding and agile practices. Supported several production-live versions leading up to the final release on December 6,
2013.

Also worked on dev-ops related items including: automated build for continuous integration, scripting of developer
virtual machines.

Schedule into early 2014 to assist in the removal of unnecessary technical stack, which will include the removal of
Enterprise Java Means and migrating from WebSphere to Tomcat.


#### Consultant, Smart Grid Company

Originally introduced to help with refactoring of a system but instead switched to agile enablement as the current
solution was a symptom of a systemic problem. Assisted the team in the introduction of many of the Scrum practices,
identification of and elimination of bottlenecks in their overall software development process and the creation of a
preliminary backlog for new work. Continued with assisting in identification of the work that needed to be done,
estimation on delivery possibility versus promises and helped introduce some of the XP practices into another team.

This organization also needed to grow and I assisted in the definition and application of an interview process for
several roles: Business Analyst, Quality Assurance (with emphasis on automation), Senior Developer.
