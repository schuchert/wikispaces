**Technical Lead, Client-Facing Responsive Web Presence **
Worked as a technical lead for a customer-facing application developed to test out modes of client interaction. The technical stack initially included Angular on the front end, Node in the mid-tier and a back end aggregation layer. After a pivot based on customer research, the front-end solution simplified to simply JavaScript and JQuery, maintaining the Node back end. Also assisted in solving inconsistent automated test execution based on changes to the technology stack after the pivot.
