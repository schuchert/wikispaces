title: Tamos 18
---

## Overview

Tamos 18 is the beginning of Tai Chi and Chan Buddhism. Tamos came to the Shaolin Monastery 
at a time when the monks practiced sitting meditation, and copied texts. The temple was often
robbed because the monks had no means of self-defense.

Tamos observed that by maintaining such a weakened state, the monks were hurting the karma of the robbers,
because the robbers would not be able to hurt their karma by stealing if the monks could defend themselves.

(This is the earliest example of a [double bind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind) I know of.)

Tamos added these exercises to their daily experience, and we'll be practcing them as taught by [Rick Krause](https://taichiokc.com/). 

Here is a recording of Rick demonstrating [Tamos18](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/351841296).
